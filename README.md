Sliding Window pattern

### 1. LeetCode (Beginner Friendly)

* **[Maximum Average Subarray I](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-average-subarray-i/)**
* *The perfect starter.* Find a fixed-size window of length `k` with the highest average.


* **[Defuse the Bomb](https://leetcode.com/problems/defuse-the-bomb/)**  -ReWatch
* A fun variation where the window can look "forward" or "backward" depending on a key.


* **[Substrings of Size Three with Distinct Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/substrings-of-size-three-with-distinct-characters/)**
* Uses a fixed window of 3 to check for uniqueness.


* **[Minimum Swaps to Group All 1's Together II](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-swaps-to-group-all-1s-together-ii/)**
* (Often labeled Medium, but the "Easy" logic is: find a window of size `total_ones` that contains the most `1`s).

### 2. HackerRank & GeeksforGeeks

* **[Subarray Division (HackerRank)](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/the-birthday-bar/problem)**
* Classic "birthday chocolate" problem. You need a contiguous segment of length `m` that sums to `d`.


* **[Max Sum Subarray of size K (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/max-sum-subarray-of-size-k5313/1)**
* The most fundamental version of the problem we just solved, but with a **fixed** window size.


* **[Count Distinct Elements in Every Window (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/count-distinct-elements-in-every-window/1)**
* Great for practicing how to use a dictionary/hashmap inside your window.
